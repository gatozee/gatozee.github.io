                    <p>SJ Studio is an independent software development studio founded on the belief that great software comes from passion, expertise, and a commitment to excellence. We're not a large corporation with layers of management – we're developers who love what we do and take pride in every project we deliver.</p>
                    <p>Our independent status is our strength. It means every client gets direct access to the people actually building their software. It means we can be selective about the projects we take on, ensuring we're fully committed to each one. And it means we can maintain the high standards that define our work.</p>

            <h2>Why Independent Development?</h2>
            <p>The software development landscape is filled with agencies, consulting firms, and large corporations. So why choose an independent studio?</p>
            
            <h3>Direct Communication</h3>
            <p>When you work with us, you're talking directly to the people writing your code. No account managers, no layers of bureaucracy – just clear, efficient communication between you and your development team.</p>
            
            <h3>Personal Investment</h3>
            <p>Every project we take on matters to us personally. We're not trying to maximize billable hours or juggle dozens of clients. We're focused on doing exceptional work that we can be proud of.</p>
            
            <h3>Flexibility & Adaptability</h3>
            <p>Being independent means we can pivot quickly when requirements change. We're not bound by rigid processes or corporate policies. We adapt our approach to fit your needs, not the other way around.</p>
            
            <h3>Fair Pricing</h3>
            <p>Without the overhead of large organizations, we can offer competitive rates while maintaining the highest quality standards. You pay for expertise and results, not corporate infrastructure.</p>
